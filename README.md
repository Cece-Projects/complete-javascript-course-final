### Q11: How do I get my certificate of completion?

**A:** A certificate of completion is provided by Udemy after you complete 100% of the course. After completing the course, just click on the "Your progress" indicator in the top right-hand corner of the course page. If you want to change your name on the certificate, please [contact the Udemy support team](https://support.udemy.com/hc/en-us).

### Q14: I'm looking for the old course version (v1) files. Where can I find them?

**A:** They are in this same repo, but in the [v1 branch](https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann/complete-javascript-course/tree/v1). So just go to [v1](https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann/complete-javascript-course/tree/v1), and download the code from there.
